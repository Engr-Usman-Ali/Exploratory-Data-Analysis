# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. The analysis aims to understand the data, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between different features of the dataset.
# Objective
The primary objective of this EDA is to:
- Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables.
- Conduct bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Create correlation heatmaps to visualize feature correlations.
- Use various visualizations such as box plots, histograms, and pair plots to present findings.
- Summarize key insights derived from the analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Iris dataset, which includes the following features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

# Key Steps in the Analysis
# 1. Univariate Analysis:
Histograms and box plots are created to visualize the distribution of each feature.

# 2. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:
Pair plots and scatter plots are used to explore relationships between features.

# 3. Correlation Heatmap:
A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation coefficients between features.

# 4. Visualization:
Clear visualizations with appropriate labels are created to enhance understanding.

# Insights
The EDA reveals significant insights into the Iris dataset, including:
- Distinct separations between species based on petal dimensions.
- Strong correlations between petal length and petal width.
- The potential for using petal dimensions as strong indicators for species classification.
